## Flask AI Recommendation Service

### Overview

The Flask AI Recommendation Service provides personalized product recommendations for an eCommerce platform. It leverages machine learning models to analyze user interactions and product categories, thereby enhancing user experience through tailored suggestions. This service is designed to receive asynchronous updates from the eCommerce service, allowing it to maintain up-to-date data for accurate recommendations.

the main service is hosted on port `5050` 
while the recommendatio api is hosted on port `5001`

### Tech Stack
#### E-commerce Service
- python, Django, Django REST Framework, PostgreSQL, Redis [cache and broker], celery,  Docker, Docker Compose

#### Ai Recommendation Service
- python Flask, scikit learn, kmeans, knn, Mongodb, Redis [ broker], celery beat, Docker


#### Third-Party Integration

I integrated [https://api.freecurrencyapi.com](https://api.freecurrencyapi.com) for the latest conversion rates.

#### Application Flow: Thought Process 

Since the requirements specifically ask for logout functionality and we are using JWT, I implemented a custom middleware that logs users' tokens in the Redis cache to prevent further access. Redis cache is used for storing blacklisted tokens to avoid hitting the main database at every request. Further consideration may involve partitioning Redis for better performance. There is also an endpoint for blacklisting refresh tokens.

There is a table for users, products, and stores in the main app. Products are attached to stores, and stores are attached to users (owners). Since there was no clear understanding of the relationships, every non-admin user is considered a vendor and gets a store by default so they can easily go ahead and create their first product. There is also an endpoint to create another store if the vendor wants and add products to it. 

**Role:**
- Users cannot manage another user's items (store, profiles, products); they cannot add products to a store they don't own, while admins can manage all resources.

The AI recommendation is built on Flask for lightweight consideration since only a few endpoints are required. It is integrated with MongoDB for faster data access for model training and product recommendation. Since the whole structure here is flat, it is mainly expected to be internal to the main API, so its endpoints, especially those that require mutations, need a client header secret. I have added this in the environment so the services can communicate with each other. If you use the Postman YAML doc I provided, it contains this header secret so you can experiment with it.

Users can register through the authentication endpoint, access, view, and manage their profiles. Admins can also register and manage all users as requested via their IDs. Please note that users don't need IDs to manage their personal profiles; the auth token is enough to fetch profile details.

All utility functions that call external APIs are cached to prevent frequent external API hits, which also helps to manage API rate limits.

I had created unit test cases that covers all edge cases in the main ecommerce service


### Documentation

There is auto-generated documentation for the main service available at:

- [http://localhost:5050/](http://localhost:5050/)
- [http://localhost:5050/redoc/](http://localhost:5050/redoc/)

There are also a `ai-recommendation-service.postman_collection.json` and `Main E-commerce API service.postman_collection.json` files in the root folder that contains the Postman API collection. Happy experimenting!


### Setup Instructions

You can easily set up the service locally using Docker and Docker Compose. I added a `make.bat` file for Windows users and a `Makefile` for Unix-like environments.

Simply hit:

- `make start` 

to spin up the two services, and 

- `make down` 

to pull down the containers.

Use `make test-all` to run unit tests.

You can also set it up manually:

1. Navigate to the `main-web` directory:
   ```bash
   cd main-web
   ```
2. Start the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
3. Navigate back to the root directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```
   And boom! You have the services up: 
   - Main web on port 5050 
   - AI API on port 5001

4. Next, navigate to the `recommendation-ai` directory:
   ```bash
   cd recommendation-ai
   ```
5. Start the Docker containers for the AI API:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
6. Navigate back to the `main-web` directory:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

To run tests with coverage, use:
```bash
docker compose exec api coverage manage.py test
```


### Authentication

All API requests require authentication. Users must obtain a token via an authentication process and include it in the headers of their requests:

#### Authentication Header
```plaintext
Authorization: Token <your_token_here>
```

  - The following endpoints are publicly accessible:
    - `/interaction-recommendations`
    - `/category-recommendations`
  
- **Protected Endpoints:** 
  - All other endpoints require a valid token for access, as they are intended for internal use by the eCommerce service. Requests to these endpoints must include a token in the `CLIENT_HEADER_SECRET` header. I have provided in the environment for seamless communication

#### Token Middleware

The service implements a token middleware to enforce access control:

```python

class TokenMiddleware:
    
```

### Asynchronous Integration

The Flask AI Recommendation Service is designed endpoints to listen for updates from the eCommerce service, which includes:

#### 1. User Interactions

- **Endpoint:** `POST /ai/interactions`
  - This endpoint allows the eCommerce service to send user interaction data asynchronously, ensuring that the recommendation system has access to the latest interaction information for generating personalized recommendations.

#### 2. Product Updates

- **Endpoint:** `POST /ai/products`
  - This endpoint enables the eCommerce service to add new products to the recommendation system without blocking other operations. This ensures that the product catalog remains current and can be utilized for recommendations immediately.

### Conclusion

The Flask AI Recommendation Service provides a robust framework for delivering personalized product recommendations in an eCommerce context. With its integration of machine learning models, periodic training, and support for asynchronous updates from the eCommerce service, this system offers a dynamic and efficient way to enhance user experience. Use the provided API endpoints to utilize the recommendation capabilities effectively.


### Limitations

Due to time constraints, I could not write tests for the AI service, as it was actually considered optional.

For ease of experimenting, all environment variables are made public in the repository.
